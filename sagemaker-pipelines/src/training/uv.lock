# This would be generated by running 'uv lock' after setting up the project
# The lock file ensures reproducible builds by pinning exact versions
# of all dependencies and their transitive dependencies.

# Example structure (actual file would be much longer):
# [[package]]
# name = "pandas"
# version = "2.1.3"
# source = { registry = "https://pypi.org/simple" }
# dependencies = [
#     { name = "numpy" },
#     { name = "python-dateutil" },
# ]

# Run 'uv lock' to generate the actual lock file with all dependencies
